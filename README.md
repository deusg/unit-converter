# Unit Converter

This Python script prompts the user to input values for inches, pounds, and Fahrenheit temperature. It then performs the following conversions:

1. Inches to Centimeters: It takes the input value in inches, converts it to centimeters using the conversion factor 2.54, and prints the result.

2. Pounds to Kilograms: It takes the input value in pounds, converts it to kilograms by dividing by 2.2, and prints the result.

3. Fahrenheit to Celsius: It takes the input value in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius using the formula (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9, and prints the result.

The code includes input validation to ensure that the user enters numeric values for the conversions. If the user enters a non-numeric value, it displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid input.
